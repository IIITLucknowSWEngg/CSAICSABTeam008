Users must be able to share and upload various file types (e.g., text documents, PDFs, images, videos) within channels.
The platform should support drag-and-drop file uploads and provide preview options for supported file types.

Collaboration Features

Include tools for collaborative work, such as comments on content, file attachments, and shared note-taking.
Support real-time updates and notifications for changes in channels and content.

Search and Filtering

Users should be able to search for content, channels, and users within servers.
Provide filtering options to sort content by type, date, or relevance.

Notification System

Implement a notification system to alert users of important updates, mentions, or messages.
Notifications should be configurable, allowing users to set preferences for different types of alerts.

2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

Security

Implement robust security measures, including end-to-end encryption for sensitive content and secure communication channels.
Ensure user data privacy and protection against unauthorized access.

Performance

The platform must handle high traffic volumes and multiple concurrent users without performance degradation.
Optimize load times and response times for content retrieval and user interactions.

Scalability

Design the system architecture to support scalability, allowing it to handle a growing number of users, servers, and content.
Implement load balancing and distributed data storage solutions to manage increased demand.

Usability

The user interface should be intuitive, responsive, and easy to navigate for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
Provide accessible design features and support for different languages and locales.

Reliability

Ensure high availability and reliability of the platform, with minimal downtime and robust backup procedures.
Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms to maintain data integrity and user experience.

2.3 User Scenarios

Scenario 1: Student Collaboration

A student creates a server for a group project, invites members, and sets roles such as admins and note-takers. The group uses channels to share notes, discuss assignments, and store relevant documents.

Scenario 2: Content Sharing for Creators

A content creator sets up a server to share exclusive content with subscribers. They assign different access levels to subscribers and manage content through dedicated channels.

Scenario 3: Professional Team Collaboration

A professional team creates a server for a specific project, where they collaborate on documentation, track progress, and conduct video meetings. They utilize channels for different project aspects and manage roles and permissions.


3. System Requirements

3.1 Platform

Concord must be accessible via web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and mobile applications (iOS and Android).

3.2 Browser Support

Ensure compatibility with major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, with responsive design for various screen sizes.

3.3 Mobile Support

Develop native or hybrid mobile applications to ensure a seamless experience on smartphones and tablets.

3.4 Integration with External Services

Integrate with third-party services for file storage (e.g., cloud storage solutions), real-time messaging, and authentication (e.g., OAuth providers).


4. User Access and Authentication

4.1 Sign-up/Login

Users should be able to sign up and log in using email, third-party login services (Google, Facebook), or Single Sign-On (SSO) systems.

4.2 Account Management

Users must be able to manage account settings, including updating personal information, changing passwords, and configuring privacy settings.

4.3 Authentication Security

Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance account security and protect against unauthorized access.


5. User Interface Requirements

5.1 Dashboard

Provide a user-friendly dashboard that displays all servers the user is a part of, along with recent activity and notifications.

5.2 Server List

Each server should have a list view showing channels, members, and recent activity. Users should be able to easily navigate between servers.

5.3 Server Customization

Allow users to personalize server settings, including naming servers, assigning roles, and configuring privacy settings.

5.4 Responsive Design

Ensure the user interface is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes and devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.


6. Assumptions and Dependencies

6.1 Third-Party Integrations

The platform may rely on third-party services for functionalities such as file storage, real-time messaging, and authentication. Ensure compatibility and integration with these services.

6.2 User Devices

Users are expected to access Concord from various devices, including PCs, tablets, and smartphones. The platform should support these devices and provide a consistent experience.

6.3 Network Connectivity

Reliable internet connectivity is assumed for accessing and using the platform. Implement offline functionality and synchronization where feasible.
