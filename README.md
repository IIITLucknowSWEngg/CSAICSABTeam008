# Project Description
Concord is a real-time communication platform inspired by Discord, designed to facilitate seamless interaction between individuals and groups. Developed with a focus on scalability, efficiency, and a user-friendly interface, Concord aims to provide robust voice, video, and text communication services. This project explores key software engineering principles, such as modularity, scalability, and reliability, to create a comprehensive solution for real-time collaboration.
## Key Points

- **Modular Architecture:** Microservices-based design for independent feature development and fault tolerance.
- **Scalability:** Cloud-based infrastructure with dynamic scaling and load balancing to handle user demand.
- **Real-time Communication:** Uses WebSockets and WebRTC for low-latency voice, video, and text communication.
- **User Management:** Role-based access control (RBAC) for flexible permissions in channels, servers, and chats.
- **Reliability:** Distributed systems with redundancy and automated failover for minimal downtime.
- **Data Persistence & Security:** Secure data storage with encryption and optimized databases for message and media management.
